<h2> Book Description </h2>

Applied sciences, both physical and social,  such as atmospheric, biological, climate, demographic, economic, ecological, environmental, oceanic and political,  routinely gather large volumes of spatial and spatio-temporal data in order to make wide ranging inference and prediction. Ideally such   inferential tasks should be  approached through modeling as modeling automatically aids in estimation of uncertainties in all conclusions drawn from such data. Unified Bayesian modeling, implemented through user friendly software packages, provides a crucial key to unlocking the full power of these methods for solving challenging practical problems. 
<p> 
Keeping the applied scientists  in mind, this book presents most of the modeling with the help of R commands written in a purposefully developed <b> R</b> package to  facilitate spatio-temporal modeling. However, the presentation in the book does not lose sight of mathematical and statistical rigor as it presents the underlying theories of Bayesian inference and computation in stand alone chapters in the first part which would be appealing to  mathematics/statistics major final year undergraduate or post-graduate students who are in search of such modeling.

<h2>  Key features of the book: </h2>



<ul>
<li> Accessible detailed discussion of a majority of all aspects of Bayesian methods and computations with worked examples, numerical illustrations and exercises with which the reader should be able to experience the methodologies live.
</li> 
<li> A spatial statistics jargon buster chapter that enables the reader to build up a vocabulary without getting clouded in modeling and technicalities in model fitting.
</li>
<li> Computation and modeling illustrations are provided with the help of the dedicated R package <b> bmstdr</b>. The look and feel of the model fitting commands and their output resemble that of the <b> lm </b> command in <b> R</b>. A novice user, who is  otherwise familiar with the <b> lm</b> command, will quickly be able to perform spatio-temporal modeling using well-known packages and platforms such <b> rstan, INLA, spBayes, spTimer, spTDyn, CARBayes </b> and  <b> CARBayesST. </b>
  </li>
  
<li> Included are <b> R </b> code notes detailing the algorithms used to produce all the tables and figures. An online supplement presents the necessary data and the full code for reproducing these results.
  </li>
<li> Two dedicated chapters discuss practical examples  of spatio-temporal modeling of point referenced and areal unit data. Taken from a variety of disciplines all illustrations are practical data driven rather than simulation based. 
  </li>
<li> Throughout, the emphasis has been on validating models by splitting data into test and training sets following on the philosophy of machine learning and data science. The last chapter consolidates this connection formally by bringing in the Gaussian process based machine learning into the context of the topics  presented in the book.   
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
This book is designed to make spatio-temporal modeling and analysis accessible and understandable to a wide audience from bachelors, masters and PhD students to researchers, from mathematicians and statisticians to practitioners in applied sciences.
By avoiding hard core mathematics and calculus, this book aims to be a bridge that removes the statistical knowledge gap from among the applied scientists.
